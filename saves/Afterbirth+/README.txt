Instructions:

- To automatically install the save file, run the "isaac-save-installer" program.
- To manually install the save file, copy the "persistentgamedata.dat" file into the appropriate location and rename it to the correct file name.

Notes:

- This is a fully unlocked save file for The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+. It also includes the extra achievements that were included in Booster Pack 5.
- It has 999 coins in the Donation Machine, and 999 coins in the Greed Donation Machine.
- It has 10,000,000 Eden Tokens.
- You can put the save file into any slot you want. You can even put it in all 3 slots.
- You do NOT need to have 3 fully unlocked save files; the only thing that changes is that you get a custom graphic on the file select screen.
